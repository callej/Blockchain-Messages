# Blockchain-Messages
A small and extremely basic and simple implementation of a blockchain with chat messages as part of JetBrains Academy's Kotlin Basic Track. It also includes a simulation of the blockchain with simulated users and miners using the blockchain and adding chat messages to the conversation. The miners are mining for free with no rewards for their work.
